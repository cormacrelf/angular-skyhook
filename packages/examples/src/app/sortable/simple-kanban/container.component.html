<div class="text">
    <app-example-link path="sortable/simple-kanban"></app-example-link>
    <p>
        This example uses <code>@angular-skyhook/sortable</code>.
        It's similar to the other one, but doesn't use <code>@ngrx</code>, just <code>Immer</code>.
        There are two kinds of sortable in play here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>One
            <span class="span span--darkblue">horizontal</span> one, whose 'cards' are the vertical lists. Try grabbing a whole list by its header, and reordering.</li>
        <li>Many
            <span class="span span--light">vertical</span> ones, which contain the kanban cards. Try moving the cards between lists.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="relative">
    <kanban-board></kanban-board>
</div>
