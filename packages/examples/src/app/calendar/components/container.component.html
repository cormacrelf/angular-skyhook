<div class="text">

    <ul>
        <li>Drag over the calendar to create a multi-day event.</li>
        <li>Double-click (or Force Touch) to create a normal event.</li>
        <li>Grab an event and move it around</li>
        <li>Resize a multi-day event with the handles on the end.</li>
    </ul>

        Requires support for CSS grid and
        <code>display: contents;</code>.
        (<a target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-display-contents">View on caniuse.com</a>). This is probably too fiddly to use on mobile.

        Note that this uses a full-on
        <code>@ngrx/store</code> setup, and almost 1:1 actions to dnd-core events. This reflects the need to broadcast the state changes and computed
        values to every subscriber, not just the components where drags and drops begin or end.

        The design was mostly borrowed from the macOS calendar, and the CSS pattern is from <a target="_blank" href="https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/calendar-css-grid">
